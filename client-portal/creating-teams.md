# Creating Teams in the Client Portal

## What you need
* Your [Client Portal](https://core.thermo.io/login/) username and password. If you cannot locate this information, click **Forget Password?** on the Client Portal loging page, or [contact a Thermo Physicist](mailto:physicists@thermo.io).
* Existing team members; see [Adding Team Members in the Client Portal](https://www.thermo.io/how-to/client-portal/adding-team-members) for more information.

## Method
Your Client Portal uses three default roles: Superuser, Billing, and Technical. If you prefer, you can create your own teams and associated permissions by using the method below. 

1. Log in to the [Client Portal](https://core.thermo.io/login/).
2. From the <**Your_Name**> list on the upper right, click **Team**.

4. Fom the Create a Team panel, in the **Team Name** field, enter your desired name, then in the **Notifications** drop-down list, select one or more notification types for this team to receive: Billing, Technical, Abuse, or Affiliate.

5. Designate which areas this team has access to by choosing the **View**, **Edit**, or **Delete** check box. If you leave a section blank, then the team has no access to that area. Click **SUBMIT** when done.

6. Assign your desired team members to the new team. See [Assigning Team Members in the Client Portal](https://www.thermo.io/how-to/client-portal/assigning-teams) for more information. You may also edit these teams by following the instructions in [Editing Teams in the Client Portal](https://www.thermo.io/how-to/client-portal/editing-team-members).
