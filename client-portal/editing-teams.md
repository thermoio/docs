# Editing Teams in the Client Portal

## What you need
* Your [Client Portal](https://core.thermo.io/login/) username and password. If you cannot locate this information, click **Forget Password?** on the Client Portal loging page, or [contact a Thermo Physicist](mailto:physicists@thermo.io).
* An existing team ; see [Creating Teams in the Client Portal](https://www.thermo.io/how-to/client-portal/creating-teams) for more information.

## Method
Your Client Portal uses three default roles: Superuser, Billing, and Technical. If you prefer, you can create your own teams and associated permissions by using the method below. 

**Attention:** This method edits team permissions; if you want to instead assign someone to a team, see [Assigning Team Members in the Client Portal](https://www.thermo.io/how-to/client-portal/assigning-teams) for more information.

1. Log in to the [Client Portal](https://core.thermo.io/login/).
2. From the <**Your_Name**> list on the upper right, click **Team**.

4. If you chose **delete**, then confirm when prompted. If you chose **edit**, you may now edit the role name, change notifications, or change permissions.

**Attention:** You may not delete the Superuser role or its permissions, though you may designate which notifications the Superuser will receive.
   
5. Click **Save**.
