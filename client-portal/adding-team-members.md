   * This person will receive an email with a link to a form requiring his or her email address, name, and password to gain access to this account.
   * Alternatively, if the user is already active on a separate Client Portal account, they should use the option to use an existing login rather than enter the above information.

See [Editing team members in the Client Portal](URL pending) for more information.
