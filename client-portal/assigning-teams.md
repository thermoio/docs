# Assigning Teams in the Client Portal

## What you need
* Your [Client Portal](https://www.thermo.io/login/) username and password. If you cannot locate this information, click **Forget Password?** on the Client Portal loging page, or [contact a Thermo Physicist](mailto:physicists@thermo.io).
* An existing team ; see [Creating Teams in the Client Portal](https://www.thermo.io/how-to/client-portal/creating-teams) for more information.

## Method
Your Client Portal uses three default roles: Superuser, Billing, and Technical. If you prefer, you can create your own teams and associated permissions by using the method below. Alternatively, you can modify the Billing and Technical teams by following the instructions provided [Editing Teams in the Client Portal](https://www.thermo.io/how-to/client-portal/editing-teams). 

**Attention:** Use care when designating team members as a Superuser role, which has unrestricted access to all permissions. 

1. Log in to the [Client Portal](https://www.thermo.io/login/).
2. From the <**Your_Name**> list on the upper right, click **Team**.
