title: Title in Headline-Style Punctuation
subject: topic, use existing topics in Thermo Library whenever possible

# Article Template

## Overview (if necessary)
This is a one-to-two paragraph description of the article's objective. Include any useful background information. Omit this section for very simple or clear-cut procedures.

## What you need (or) But first... 
* If only one requirement, use "But first..." as shown [here](https://github.com/thermoio/docs/blob/master/security/updating-centos.md).
* If multiple requirements, use "What you need" and list them in bullets and include links to any other useful resources in the Thermo library, if available. Go [here](https://github.com/thermoio/docs/blob/master/client-portal/adding-team-members.md) for an example.

## 1: Describe first task
Use sentence-style punctuation for all headers other than the title. For simple procedures not requiring multiple procedural sections, use "Method" and cut the "1:". If you require multiple sections, use the simple present tense; for example "1: Install patch," "2: Update user list," and so on.

Example code input follows using the `sudo` command:

1. Prep the system by making sure everything is up to date:
   ```shell
   sudo yum update
   ```
2. Set up the common EPEL repository:
   ```shell
   sudo yum install epel-release
   sudo yum update
   ```

## 2: Describe second task
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

## 3: Describe third task
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
