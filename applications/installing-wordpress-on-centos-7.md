# Installing WordPress on CentOS 7

## What you need
* Sudo access; see [Creating sudo users](https://www.thermo.io/how-to/security/creating-sudo-users) for instructions.  
* SA functioning LAMP stack; see [Setting up LAMP stack on CentOS 7](https://www.thermo.io/how-to/web-servers/setting-up-lamp-stack-on-centos7) for more information.

## 1: Install Wget and Nano
This step installs Wget, a web content retrieval package, and Nano, a file editor. Both will make your installation easier.
 
To install Wget, enter:
```shell
sudo yum install wget
```
To install Nano, enter:
```shell
sudo yum install nano
```
## 2: Create your database
In order to store and access information on a WordPress site, you must first set up a database in the MySQL section of your LAMP stack. 
1. Start this process by accessing your MySQL root account:
   ```shell
   mysql -u root -p
   ```
2. In MySQL, create and name the database, replacing `<database>` and the angled brackets with your desired name: 
   ```shell
   CREATE DATABASE <database>;
   ```
3. Create a user for that database, once again replacing the angled brackets (`<>`) and everything between them with your desired information:
   ```shell
   CREATE USER <username>@localhost IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';
   ```
4. Grant that user permissions for that database:
   ```shell
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON <database>.* TO <user_name>@localhost IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';
   ```
5. Finally, flush the privileges so MySQL learns about the recent changes, then exit MySQL:
   ```shell
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   exit
   ```
## 3: Download and install WordPress
This step uses the previously installed Wget to install WordPress.
1. To download the WordPress installation package, issue:
   ```shell
   cd ~
   wget http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
   ```
2. Unpack and install the package:
   ```shell
   tar xzvf latest.tar.gz
   ```
3. Complete installation: 
   ```shell
   sudo rsync -avP ~/wordpress/ /var/www/html/
   ```
4. Complete a folder for uploads:
   ```shell
   mkdir /var/www/html/wp-content/uploads
   ```
5. Assign permissions: 
   ```shell
   sudo chown -R apache:apache /var/www/html/*
   ```
## 4: This step configures your new WordPress installation to connect to the MySQL database you created in Section 2.
1. Change to the Apache root directory storing the configuration file:
   ```shell
   cd /var/www/html
   ```
2. Create a copy of the default `wp_config.php` file in that directory:
   ```shell
   cp wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php
   ```
3. Open the file in a text editor:
   ```shell
   nano wp-config.php
   ```
4. Locate the section `MySQL settings`, then replace the variables for `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, and `DB_PASSWORD` with the `<database>`, `<username>`, and `<password>` variables you created in Section 2. 

**Attention:** Do not include the angled brackets (`<>`), which signify placeholder information.

   ```shell
   // ** MySQL settings - You can get this info from your web host ** //
   /** The name of the database for WordPress */
   define('DB_NAME', '<database>');

   /** MySQL database username */
   define('DB_USER', '<username>');

   /** MySQL database password */
   define('DB_PASSWORD', '<password>);
   ```
5. Save, then exit.

Congratulations! Installation is complete. You may visit your site by entering the web address in any web browser.
